## Project Overview

The CPP Modules repository is a collection of exercises and projects aimed at mastering the fundamentals of C++ programming language. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax and data types to advanced concepts like templates, exceptions, and design patterns.

The repository is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for students at 42 School, but it can also be a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning or improving their C++ skills.

The repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different module (e.g., `CPP00`, `CPP01`, `CPP02`, etc.). Within each module directory, there are subdirectories for individual exercises (`ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, etc.). Each exercise directory contains the source code files, header files, and other relevant files for that particular exercise.

## How to Run the Project

To run the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPP_Modules.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired module and exercise directory:

```bash
cd CPP_Modules/CPP01/ex00
```

3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`):

```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.cpp
```

4. Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./a.out
```

Some exercises may require additional steps or have specific instructions. Please refer to the exercise descriptions or comments within the source code for more details.

## Main Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The repository covers OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Templates**: Exercises on templates, including function templates and class templates.
- **Exceptions and Error Handling**: Proper use of exceptions and error handling techniques.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Implementation of various algorithms and data structures using C++.
- **File I/O and Streams**: Exercises on file input/output operations and stream manipulation.
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

## Front-end Logic

Most of the exercises in this repository are focused on the back-end logic and do not involve front-end development. However, some exercises may include basic user input/output or command-line interface (CLI) interactions.

## Back-end Logic

The back-end logic of the exercises covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementation of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Templates**: Use of function templates and class templates for generic programming.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Implementation of various algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) and data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, stacks, queues).
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `new`, `delete`, and smart pointers.
- **File I/O and Streams**: File input/output operations and stream manipulation.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper use of exceptions for error handling and resource management.
- **Operator Overloading**: Overloading operators for custom data types.
- **Iterators and Containers**: Use of iterators and standard containers (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`).
